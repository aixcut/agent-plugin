# Verify Aixcut Results

Apply the packaged shared [quality gates](../../references/core/quality-gates.md), binding each evidence item to the actual Project, timeline, revision and sampled interval.

## Conversation guidance

Separate verified facts, unresolved checks, and the next step. Report only what the read-back or review confirms; if a check is unavailable, say what remains unverified and how to complete it.

Every write needs the verification appropriate to the request. A tool result of `applied` is not by itself a final conclusion.

After each atomic batch of structural writes, immediately read back every affected view before continuing. One call that carries the whole batch counts as one batch; do not reread between the items of a single batch. Timeline, audio or voice, and caption writes require rereading the affected `timeline`, audio or `speech`, and `captions` views so the returned refs and state are current.

## Short path

1. Read the affected view, such as `timeline`, `captions`, `speech`.
2. Call a published review operation for structural checks.
3. Capture frames when the user needs visual confirmation.
4. Report what passed and what was not checked.

## Review scope

| view | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `project` | Overall Project structure and tracks. |
| `timeline` | Clip order, duration, gaps, and overlaps. |
| `timeline` plus `speech` read-back | Voice script, effective profile, and separate timeline placement. |
| `renderability` | Static structure, source availability, and valid duration. Do not apply removed server-renderer v1 limits. Canvases beyond the 4K UHD pixel budget produce a `CANVAS_HIGH_RESOLUTION` warning; do not change the canvas automatically. |

## Visual verification

Frame capture is conditional. It is required when:

- Any visual clip's position or size changes, or another visual is layered at the same time.
- A lower third, caption position, or caption visibility changes.
- The user asks whether something is obscured or how it looks.

Do not capture frames for timing-only edits (trim, split, move, or speed), volume, or fades when they do not change the visible composition; volume and fades use audio evidence instead. Skip timing-only frame capture only when the final visible composition is unchanged. If the edit changes which image is visible, subtitle placement, or the layer relationship at any sampled time, capture the affected timeline frames. Without actual playback or listening, volume and fades remain `unjudgeable`, not a quality pass.

### Capture procedure

- Use `aixcut_frontend_capture_source_frames()` for source footage and `capture_timeline_frames` for the timeline composition.
- `selections` contains 1–8 entries. Each entry must use exactly one form: `{"times_ms":[2000,7000]}` (up to 16 timeline points or 24 source points) or `{"start_ms":0,"end_ms":6000,"count":3}`. Do not mix forms within an entry.
- Capture 1–8 frames in one call and stop when sufficient; do not keep capturing.
- Pass `expected_revision` when the latest revision matters. `MCP_FRONTEND_TIMELINE_STALE` means the timeline changed; reread it before deciding whether to capture again.
- If capture returns `CAPTURE_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`, ask the user to click anywhere on the Project page, then retry the same request. Do not reimport media.
- Captured frames are temporary JPEG URLs. Provide usable links to the user when available; do not claim that the MCP server wrote them to the user's computer.

### Inspecting the composition

- Timeline capture results include a `composition` roster. Use it to map visible elements to refs rather than guessing.
- `composition.frames` gives each captured frame's `index`, `times_ms`, and visible items with ref, time range, track, and `visual_position`. `index` matches the image order. Items with `enabled: false` are absent from the rendered frame.
- If `frames` is missing, use `composition.clips` as the full timeline roster and map each image to its time.
- The roster's `visual_position` should match the read-back: `preset` is a named position, `box` is a freeform proportional box, and `auto` means the editor is arranging it automatically.
- If an element obscures another element or captions, report the offending ref and return the change to `aixcut-timeline-editing`; after the edit, capture again. Verification is read-only and must not fix the position itself. Do not infer the corrected result from the first image.

## 有界播放检查

仅当公开 Schema 包含此动作时，使用 `aixcut_frontend_playback_check()`，携带当前页面的 `timeline_id`、最新 `expected_revision`、`start_ms` 和 `target_ms`；一次区间最多 10 秒。它会短时播放并还原播放头，不修改工程；用户正在播放时拒绝接管。只有 `started=true`、`reached_target=true`、`interrupted=false`、`playback_error=null` 才能证明该区间的播放时钟推进。绑定过期时重新读取，用户接管时停止检查。

`audio_track_present` 仅证明轨道结构，`audio_review=unjudgeable` 仍需实际试听。区间检查不能证明全片可播放、音画同步或声音质量，不能据此把音频证据改成 pass。

## Pre-export checks

`renderability` is a static structure check, not an export simulation. The Project page renders local or cloud media; a full cloud copy is not required. Do not reject Motion Graph or other features using obsolete server-renderer v1 limits. `renderable: true` means only that the snapshot structure passed; it does not prove the page can decode every source or that export will succeed. The final outcome is `export_timeline_status`.

Warn the user to confirm the target resolution when the canvas exceeds the 4K pixel budget because this can increase render time and file size. Do not change it without instruction.

Structural review cannot prove that the output plays fully, has synchronized audio/video, or sounds correct. MCP has no complete playback/listening check. If there is no playback or listening evidence, state “full playback/listening not verified”; do not present a passing `review` as proof of finished media quality. Caption verification must distinguish a voice script from a real transcript: the automatic caption path is complete only when the audio source has `transcript_status=available` and `aixcut_read_captions()` returns captions.

### Final review report

Report each final review dimension separately: structure, transcript, voice roles, captions, visual annotations, and double human voice risk. A passing review operation does not prove full playback or listening; when the output was not actually played or heard, state “full playback/listening not verified.”

## Boundaries

- Verification is read-only. Do not modify content during the check.
- Browser actions require the target Project page to be online. If it is offline, report that visual verification could not be completed; do not substitute structural checks for visual proof.
- Structural review and visual inspection prove different things. Report them separately.

## Completion

Each user-requested change must have a matching read-back or review result, and the summary must reflect the actual result.

## Evidence dimensions

Final evidence is reported independently for `structure`, `semantic`, `visual`, and `audio`. Each dimension is `pass`, `fail`, or `unjudgeable`; a missing composed frame or actual playback/listening evidence is `unjudgeable`, not a pass. A structural review cannot substitute for a composed timeline frame, transcript evidence, or listening evidence.

Before reporting the requested deliverable, run the packaged Core gate with `node <plugin-root>/scripts/workflow-host.mjs gate` and JSON `{evidence,current:{project_id,timeline_id,revision},deliverable:"report"|"quality"|"export"}` on stdin. `current` must be the latest inspected binding. A failed gate is a stop condition; report its reasons and the next inspection needed. This gate validates claims and revision binding; it does not itself inspect media.
